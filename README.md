# Overview

The goal of this project was to build a deep learning model using CNN architecture to classify retinal images into four categories — Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Normal.
The model aims to detect the presence of any of these eye diseases accurately, supporting faster diagnosis and better treatment planning.

# Problem Statement

Eye diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are among the major causes of vision loss worldwide. Manual screening of retinal images is time-consuming and prone to human error.
The project aims to automate this process by training a deep learning model that can accurately classify images based on disease type.

# Dataset

The dataset was taken from Kaggle (Eye Diseases Dataset) and contains labeled retinal images for each disease class.
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV
Model Architecture: CNN , EfficientNet (Transfer Learning)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
